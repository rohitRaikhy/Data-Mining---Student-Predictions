## Summary

This analysis presents the findings of data mining research carried out in the search for improving the performance of students at the high school level using data mining techniques to outline predictive measures of future student success. The different characteristics of students towards STEM and NON-STEM is taken into consideration and analyzed to determine predictive measures that better effect the performance of pursuing a field in STEM or NON-STEM. The research is focused on the use of data mining models to predict the performance of students using data related to sociodemographic and information of students at two Portuguese schools.  Several well known data mining models are used; a ridge and lasso regression model, a decision tree classifier, an artificial neural network and a support vector machine model, are applied to the data set. The performance of these algorithms are taken into consideration in the application towards predicting student performance.
